  "question": "How do I RSVP for my plus one?",
  "answer": "If you do not see the option to provide information for your plus one when you RSVP that means we did not allot one for you. Both the bride and groom have large families and a large support system, which unfortunately means invitations could not be extended to everyone that we would have liked to include."
},
{
  "question": "I forgot to RSVP by August 1st or my RSVP status has changed, what do I do?",
  "answer": "When August 2nd comes we will be inviting additional guests in place of those that did not RSVP or RSVP’d no. If you find that you missed the deadline or that you would like to change your RSVP from No to Yes, please reach out to the bride and groom at arikandchelseysmith@gmail.com and we will let you know if we still have room for you (and guest if applicable). Similarly, please reach out to us if you need to change your RSVP from Yes to No."

{
  "question": "Are children allowed to attend?",

},
{
  "question": "What is the dress code?",
  "answer": "This will be a formal event. Please reference the 'Formal or Black Tie Optional' section of this article if you’d like a detailed description of what this entails. When making your choice, remember to choose something you feel comfortable moving in because we expect to see all of your beautiful faces on the dance floor. https://www.brides.com/story/wedding-dress-code-explained#toc-formal-or-black-tie-optional"
},
{
  "question": "Will any of the events be outdoors?",
  "answer": "Yes, if the weather permits, all events will be outside. If you are wearing heels there’s no need to worry about walking in the grass. Everything will be on paved surfaces and it’ll be to your discretion whether or not you decide to stand in the grass area at any point."
},
{
  "question": "Are the reception and ceremony in the same location?",
  "answer": "Including the hotel, everything will be spread across three buildings that are all connected. After the ceremony it is a quick elevator ride down and a short walk across the lobby to get to the location of the cocktail hour and reception."
},
{
  "question": "What is the parking situation?",
  "answer": "We will be in the Flats, which is a lively area downtown. If you are staying in our hotel block you can keep your car parked in the hotel’s lot. If you are not, you can utilize the hotel’s lot or the location's valet. Another option is to utilize one of the many lots in the area, however their costs may be higher than usual due to the events happening in Cleveland the same weekend."
},
{
  "question": "How soon should we book our hotel?",
  "answer": "If you are choosing to stay at the Aloft under our block you should book as soon as possible. You can find the direct link to do so on the location tab. This hotel is typically sold out on a daily basis during the summer and our wedding weekend will be more popular than the average summer day due to the holiday weekend and airshow."
},
{
  "question": "Will there be drinks?",
  "answer": "Of course! We will have an open bar starting with the cocktail hour consisting of liquor, wine, and beer and it will continue throughout the entire night."
