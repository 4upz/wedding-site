  "question": "1. How do I RSVP for my plus one?",
  "answer": "  1. If you do not see the option to provide information for your plus one when you RSVP that means we did not allot one for you. Both the bride and groom have large families and a large support system, which unfortunately means invitations could not be extended to everyone that we would have liked to include."
